# Space

## Overview

Space is the vast, seemingly infinite expanse beyond Earth’s atmosphere.  
It contains celestial bodies, cosmic phenomena, and the foundations of the universe.

## Characteristics

- Near vacuum with extremely low pressure
- Contains stars, planets, galaxies, and black holes
- Governed by the laws of physics such as gravity and relativity
- Expands over time as described by cosmology

## Roles in Human Society

- Scientific exploration and discovery
- Navigation and satellite communications
- Source of inspiration in culture and art
- Potential future site for colonization

## Areas of Study

Some fields of space research include:  
- Astronomy  
- Astrophysics  
- Cosmology  
- Planetary science  
- Space engineering  

## Lifespan and Care

- Spacecraft must withstand radiation, vacuum, and extreme temperatures
- Human survival requires life support and protection from cosmic rays
- Satellites have limited operational lifespans
- Telescopes and probes extend human observation beyond Earth

## Fun Facts

- Space is completely silent due to lack of air
- The universe is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old
- Neutron stars can spin hundreds of times per second
- Astronauts can grow up to 5 cm taller in microgravity
