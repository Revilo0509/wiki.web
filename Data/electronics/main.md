# Electronics

## Overview

Electronics is the branch of science and technology that deals with circuits, devices, and systems using electrical energy to perform tasks.  
It underpins much of modern life, from computers to communication networks.

## Characteristics

- Based on the movement of electrons in semiconductors and conductors
- Involves circuits, transistors, diodes, and integrated chips
- Enables processing, transmission, and storage of information
- Found in both consumer devices and industrial systems

## Roles in Human Society

- Communication (phones, internet, broadcasting)
- Computing and automation
- Medical devices and healthcare
- Transportation, energy, and infrastructure

## Fields of Electronics

Some key branches include:  
- Analog electronics  
- Digital electronics  
- Microelectronics  
- Power electronics  
- Telecommunications  

## Lifespan and Care

- Devices require power sources and regular maintenance
- Lifespan depends on design, usage, and environment
- Proper cooling prevents overheating and damage
- Recycling helps reduce electronic waste

## Fun Facts

- The first transistor was invented in 1947
- Moore’s Law predicted the doubling of transistor counts every ~2 years
- LEDs are both energy-efficient and long-lasting
- Spacecraft electronics must withstand extreme radiation and temperatures
